# Repository Guidelines

## Project Goal (Rewrite)

- This repository is transitioning from the legacy PHP codebase to a TypeScript-based monorepo using pnpm workspaces.
- The legacy game remains the current active source under `legacy/` while the rewrite is prepared alongside it.
- Legacy data under `legacy/` is for migration only; once DB migration is complete,
  the runtime will no longer depend on legacy data.

## Project Naming

- Official name: 삼국지 모의전투 HiDCHe
- Common nicknames: 삼모, 삼모전, 힏체섭
- Short forms in code/docs: sammo, hidche
- TypeScript rewrite working name: sammo-ts

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `legacy/` contains the application source. This is the active codebase.
- PHP entry points live under `legacy/` and `legacy/hwe/` (for example `legacy/index.php`, `legacy/hwe/index.php`).
- `legacy/src/sammo/` contains core utility classes for the `sammo\\` namespace.
- Core PHP domain logic lives under `legacy/hwe/sammo/` (also part of the `sammo\\` namespace).
- Frontend TypeScript/Vue sources are in `legacy/hwe/ts/` with shared components in `legacy/hwe/ts/components/`.
- Styles are split between `legacy/css/` and SCSS in `legacy/hwe/scss/`.
- Tests: PHPUnit in `legacy/tests/`, TypeScript tests in `legacy/hwe/test-ts/`.
- Static data/assets: scenarios in `legacy/hwe/scenario/`, templates in `legacy/hwe/templates/`.

## Legacy Endpoint Patterns

- JSON API handlers: `legacy/hwe/j_*.php`.
- Vue multi-entry pages: `legacy/hwe/v_*.php`.
- Legacy PHP + jQuery pages: `legacy/hwe/b_*.php` with POST handlers in `legacy/hwe/c_*.php`.
- Modern API router: `legacy/hwe/api.php` accepts a path argument and dispatches to `legacy/hwe/API/` modules.

## Planned Monorepo Layout (TypeScript Rewrite)

- `/packages/common`: shared utilities and type definitions.
- `/packages/infra`: Prisma/Redis connectors and other runtime infra.
- `/packages/logic`: pure game logic with DI/interfaces for external dependencies.
- `/app/gateway-frontend`: Gateway UI application.
- `/app/gateway-api`: Gateway backend service.
- `/app/game-frontend`: Game UI application.
- `/app/game-api`: Game backend service per server+scenario profile.
- `/app/game-engine`: Game engine / turn daemon per server+scenario profile.
- `/tools/build-scripts`: build and deployment scripts.

## Planned Runtime & Tooling

- Backend: Node.js + Fastify, with Prisma ORM.
- Turn daemon: turn scheduler/resolver service for game ticks.
- Turn daemon and API server communicate via Redis Stream or Redis pub/sub.
- API server and frontend may use SSE for live updates.
- API: tRPC + zod.
- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Zustand, TanStack Query, TailwindCSS v4, shadcn/ui.
- Data: PostgreSQL; sessions backed by Redis.
- Testing: Vitest, Playwright (E2E).
- Package manager: pnpm (workspace-based monorepo).
- Build output: server builds emitted to `/dist/{profileName}` per profile.

## Suggested Monorepo Scripts (Proposal)

These are placeholders to align teams; adjust once packages exist.

- `pnpm install`: install all workspace dependencies.
- `pnpm typecheck`: run TypeScript type checks in all packages (via turbo).
- `pnpm lint`: lint all packages (via turbo).
- `pnpm test`: run all unit tests (via turbo).
- `pnpm build`: build all packages/apps (via turbo).
- `pnpm dev`: run dev servers where applicable (via turbo).
- `pnpm --filter ./app/game-frontend dev`: run a single app by filter.
- `pnpm --filter ./app/game-api dev`: run a single service by filter.
- `pnpm --filter ./app/game-engine dev`: run a single service by filter.

## Development Checklist (AI)

- After code changes, verify TypeScript type checks (prefer `pnpm build` or `pnpm typecheck`).
- When changes require unit tests, run the relevant tests.

## Build Profiles (Proposal)

- A build profile is a server+scenario pair; scenario selection is required even if a default exists.
- Server builds should accept a profile (server variant) plus an explicit scenario file input.
- Recommended pattern: `pnpm build:server --profile che --scenario default`.
- Prefer environment variables for CI/CD (`PROFILE=che SCENARIO=default pnpm build:server`) and a small wrapper script for local usage.
- Build output stays in `/dist/{profileName}` per profile to keep deployments predictable.
- Profile selection can target different git branches or specific commits; server operators decide the compatibility baseline.
- The scenario file determines unit sets and DB settings that must be prepared before build output is emitted.

## Server Profiles (Planned)

- Server IDs: `che`, `kwe`, `pwe`, `twe`, `nya`, `pya`
- Each build/run profile combines a server ID with a scenario selection.

## Game Domain Notes (Behavioral Context)

- Turn-based multiplayer loop with configurable tick length (historically 120/60/30/20/10/5/2/1 min; experimental day/night schedules).
- Core stats: leadership, strength, intelligence with effects on internal affairs and combat.
- Traits and modifiers apply via the Trigger system, evaluated by priority; "attempt" then "execute".
- Scenarios define maps, NPCs, initial resources; scenario loading separated to allow future modding.
- "Unit packs" bundle unit graphics, audio, and special effects per scenario.

## Randomness Policy (Verifiable RNG)

- All game-impacting randomness must be verifiable and reproducible from a deterministic seed.
- Prefer reusing the existing TypeScript implementations: `legacy/hwe/ts/util/LiteHashDRBG.ts` and `legacy/hwe/ts/util/RNG.ts` with minimal or no changes.
- Seed composition should include a hidden base seed plus action context (action type, time, actor, target) so results can be re-validated later.
- Do not introduce ad-hoc randomness in game logic; allow non-deterministic randomness only for non-gameplay, cosmetic, or UI-only cases.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Follow repo lint/format configuration once it exists; keep diffs consistent within a file.
- Indentation: 4 spaces for TypeScript, JSON, and Vue SFCs.
- Prefer explicit types for public APIs; avoid `any` and narrow `unknown`.
- Vue components: PascalCase filenames; composables use `useX` naming.
- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions and `PascalCase` for classes/types.
- Legacy concepts may use Korean identifiers; preserve Korean naming when it improves maintainability.
- Hybrid naming is acceptable (e.g., `use전투규칙`, `use도시상태`) when the prefix is conventional but the domain term is Korean.
- For classes, commands, and domain logic, add clear Korean comments to support Korean readers and future maintainers.
- Use strong type conventions in TypeScript. Any is not allowed, and you should also be careful about using unknown.
- Avoid dangerous casting, such as `as unknown as Something`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Git history is minimal and does not define a strict convention; use short, imperative messages (e.g., "Fix map cache loading").
- PRs should include a concise description, testing notes/commands, and screenshots for UI changes.
